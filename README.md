A simple app for showing movie trailers.

Why Should you take a look at this code?
1. follows MVP pattern.
1. written in kotlin (the new lang for android development).
2. uses RxJava for simplifying async work.
3. uses Dagger2 for dependency injections (for decoupling the view from the model + to simplify the use of unit tests).
4. uses Retrofit for handling HTTP requests (mixed with rxJava).
5. small project, easy to jump into.
